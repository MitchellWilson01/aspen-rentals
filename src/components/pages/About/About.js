            <h1>About Aspen</h1>
            <p>Aspen Industrial Machines, LLC. was created to provide rental 
            briquetting equipment for the manufacturing and recycling industries.</p>
            <p>Manufacturing Facilities running machine centers and lathes have an 
            an ongoing need to handle chips and turnings as well as to recycle 
            coolant fluids.</p>
            <p>For years, there have been companies selling briquetter systems. 
            However there has not been a "zero captial" rental option. Now, there is 
            a second option that allows you to rent top-of-the-line systems providing 
            all the value of of briquetting your material without the upfront cost.
